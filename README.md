## Introduction

CDP is an international non-profit organization that supports companies and cities disclose their environmental impact.

Once a year, the CDP voluntarily collects data and information on behalf investors on CO2 emissions, climate risks and reduction targets and strategies of companies using standardized questionnaires. The CDP now manages the world’s largest database of it’s kind.

CDP works with over 6000 corporations, as well as over 550 cities and 100 states and regions to help them ensure that an effective carbon emissions reductions strategy is made integral to their operations.

Kaggle is an online community for data scientists and machine learning practitioners. Kaggle allows users to find and publish datasets, explore and build models in a web-based data-science environment, work with other data scientists and machine learning engineers, and enter competitions to solve data science challenges.

In order to develop a methodology for calculating key performance indicators that relate to the environmental and social issues that relate to the environmental and social issues that are discussed in the survey data, the CDP launched a competition on Kaggle. These KPI’s should aim to support finding answers to the following questions.

- How do you help cities to a rapidly changing climate admits a global pandemic, but do It in a way that is social equitable?
- What are the projects that can be invested in that will help pull cities out of a recession, mitigate climate issues, but not perpetuate racial/social inequities?
- What are the practical and actionable points where city corporate ambition join, i.e. where do cities have problems that corporations affected by those problems could solve, and vice versa?
- How can we measure the intersection between environmental risks and social equity, as a contributor to resiliency?

The dataset provided by CDP contains data for the years 2018, 2019 and 2020. It contains data for the city disclosure (cid) and corporation disclosure (cod) with meta data of their respective cities or corporations. Additionally there are data (cor and cir) containing the answers for cities and corporations for the questionnaires in their respective years. 

## Our Motivation

After eight intensive weeks of listening, reading and coding at NeueFische Data Science Coding Bootcamp, the theoratical training phase comes to an end. With this capstone project we'll apply our newly acquired knowledge about Python, EDA, Machine Learning on real-world problems. 
As a highly motivated group of four students we decided to not only face one of the worlds biggest challenges with our project, but also an official [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/cdp-unlocking-climate-solutions/).
Our four-week project particularly focuses on the development of meaningful KPIs and the usage of NLP and clustering alogrithms.

## Mission Statement

*"We develop relevant KPIs to help cities and companies optimise and communicate their own climate protection strategy. The aim is to identify and visualise activities and projects that strike the best possible balance between climate protection and aspects of social justice. 
 
We rely on an extensive Exploratory Data Analysis of the CDP-Surveys with more than 1.5 million annual observations. A main focus of our work is the generation of new features and the explanation of the insights gained from them. For the interpretation and classification of unstructured free text responses we use NLP / Sentiment Analysis techniques. We use cluster algorithms to show the connections between social justice and environmental protection, as well as between the interests of the public sector and private companies."*
